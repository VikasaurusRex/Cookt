# Cookt (project from 2018-19)

## Introduction

> This project is in the process of being commented and spruced up. It was a personal project of mine for a couple years, where I worked on and off with the goal of keeping my skills sharp and having an outlet for creativity and hobby programming. Now that I am applying for various internships and other opportunities, I have opened up the repository for recruiter perousal.

> Please keep in minds, I am adding comments and documentation as I have time. This is not a huge priority as it was done for fun from the get go and as such, please excuse an bad practices as I add documentation (Added 09/24/2019)

> This was a project I worked on both to top up my skills and to learn new ones. The aim was to set up a marketplace for freshly cooked foods that allows hopeful chefs to test their cooking against the spooky scary free market. Additionally, it allows for people to try new foods that might not add up economically for a full restaurant, but might be some grandmothers passion or a small part of a culture that yearns to be shared.

## Tools Used

> The project uses a smorgasbord of interesting tools. These include: `Google Firebase` for all backend data storage. I also used `stripe` for payment processing and integration, I used `GoogleMapsAPI` for distances and times to delivery, coupled with `GoogleMaps` Flutter SDK to integrate live maps into some views. Additionally, I used `Postmates API` to integrate delivery solutions for chefs to have their food hand delivered to their houses. 

## Installation

> Clone and run a nice little `flutter packages get` and you should be good to go.
